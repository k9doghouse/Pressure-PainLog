# Pressure-PainLog
This app will retrieve a barometric pressure reading from the iPhone sensor.  The reading is then adjusted for elevation, also from the iPhone sensor.  A line chart is displayed.  A tableView of the sensor readings is presented.  This works today, on my iPhone 6s plus.  This will not work on a simulator as sim's lack sensors.
